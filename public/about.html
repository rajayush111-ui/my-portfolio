<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a focused and ambitious student who thinks seriously about my future and starts preparing early. Instead of just following a degree, I aim to build real skills and a clear career direction. 
  I plan my time well, balance studies with physical activity, and believe in discipline, self-improvement, and long-term consistency.
</p>

<p>I have a strong interest in technology, especially cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and I prefer learning through structured roadmaps and practical projects. 
  I like understanding concepts deeply, asking “why” instead of memorizing answers, and I care about building a strong profile through projects, certifications, and continuous learning.
</p>

<p>I also value purpose along with stability. I want to serve in meaningful roles, possibly in government or defense, while keeping strong private-sector options as a backup. 
  I am realistic about my choices, open to improving myself, and determined to grow into a skilled, responsible, and dependable professional.
